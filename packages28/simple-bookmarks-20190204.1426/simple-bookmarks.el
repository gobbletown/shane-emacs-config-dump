;;; Commentary:

;; A smart enhancement providing a simple but convenient interface to
;; your recently and often used bookmarks / functioncalls.

;; Actually it just holds a persistence list on disk consisting of named function calls with relevant arguments (your bookmarks). The following things are supported:
;; - Add/remove/execute(call) bookmarks consisting of a name, a function (any function), some relevant arguments/parameters and any other information you want to save with the bookmark
;; - Add/remove/execute(call) already specialized bookmarks for
;; -- find-file
;; -- dired
;; -- desktop (supports both add existing desktops to bookmark-list and create desktops)
;; -- browse-url
;; - Mini-Buffer-Completion for the functions above (should work with ido and ivy)
;; - Filter the bookmark-list by type/func what ever you want

;; To use this, add the following lines somewhere in you init file:
;; (require 'simple-bookmarks)
;; (simple-bookmarks-init)

;; handles all bookmarks:
;; (global-set-key (kbd "M-- l") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-execute-from-all)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "M-- L") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-execute)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "M-- c") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-add)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "M-- r") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-remove-from-all)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "M-- R") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-remove)

;; handles only file-bookmarks:
;; (global-set-key (kbd "M-- f l") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-execute-file)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "M-- f c") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-add-file)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "M-- f r") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-remove-file)

;; handles only directory-bookmarks:
;; (global-set-key (kbd "M-- d l") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-execute-directory)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "M-- d c") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-add-directory)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "M-- d r") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-remove-directory)

;; handles only desktop-bookmarks:
;; (global-set-key (kbd "M-- s l") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-execute-desktop)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "M-- s c") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-create-desktop)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "M-- s a") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-add-desktop)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "M-- s r") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-remove-desktop)

;; handles only url-bookmarks:
;; (global-set-key (kbd "M-- u l") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-execute-url)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "M-- u c") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-add-url)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "M-- u r") 'simple-bookmarks-interactive-remove-url)

;; Customization:

;; If there are other functions you often use, maybe itÂ´s advisable to save these function calls as bookmark. You can make your own bookmark functions. See the functions for file-bookmarks below.

;; (defun simple-bookmarks-interactive-add-file (&optional name path more)
;;   (interactive "Sfile-bookmark name: \nffile-bookmark path:\ni")
;;   (simple-bookmarks-interactive-add name 'find-file (list path) more))

;; The two functions below are just filtered versions of "simple-bookmarks-interactive-remove-file" and "simple-bookmarks-interactive-execute-file", so these are not really needed. If you want to provide them, of course you has to provide the corresponding filter.

;; (defun simple-bookmarks-interactive-remove-file ()
;;   (interactive)
;;   (simple-bookmarks-interactive-remove 'simple-bookmarks-filters-file-bookmark-p))

;; (defun simple-bookmarks-interactive-execute-file ()
;;   (interactive)
;;   (simple-bookmarks-interactive-execute 'simple-bookmarks-filters-file-bookmark-p))

;;; Code:

(require 'simple-bookmarks-utils)
(require 'simple-bookmarks-filters)
(require 'simple-bookmarks-funcs)
(require 'simple-bookmarks-interactive)

(defgroup simple-bookmarks nil
  "A smart enhancement providing a simple but convenient interface to your recently and often used bookmarks / functioncalls."
  :group 'convenience)

(defcustom simple-bookmarks-file "~/.emacs.d/simple-bookmarks"
  nil
  :type 'file
  :group 'simple-bookmarks)

(defvar simple-bookmarks-bookmarks nil)

;;;###autoload
(defun simple-bookmarks-init ()
  (setq simple-bookmarks-bookmarks (simple-bookmarks-funcs-read simple-bookmarks-file)))

(provide 'simple-bookmarks)
;;; simple-bookmarks.el ends here
