and updating file `PROJECT-autoloads.el' automatically.  Eldev
uses this file if present, so that commands like `test', `eval'
etc. can use function autoloading regardless of loading mode â€” it
works like in a real package.

If this plugin is active, a new virtual target `:autoloads' is
added to the tree.  It is built by default.  It collects forms
with preceding `;;;###autoload' cookie from all `.el' files in
the project's root.  This is exactly what is performed when a
package is installed by Emacs packaging system.  Before commands
`test', `eval' and the like are executed, Eldev makes sure that
the file is up-to-date.

It is recommended to instruct your VCS to ignore file
`PROJECT-autoloads.el', as it will be autogenerated.

When using a project with this plugin as a local dependency,
specify loading mode `built' (or `built-and-compiled',
`built-source'):

    (eldev-use-local-dependency \"...\" 'built)

(defun eldev--undercover-plugin (configuration)
  "Plugin that provides integration with `undercover' library,
generating test coverage reports for your project.  Even if the
plugin is active, it will not necessarily generate the report,
see below.

This plugin only activates if project's loading mode is `as-is',
`source' or `built-source', since the library cannot handle
byte-compiled files.  If the plugin decides to collect coverage
statistics in mode `as-is', Emacs will load source files even if
byte-compiled versions are available.

By default, it is up to `undercover' library to decide whether
and which report to generate.  Normally, it does so only on
supported continuous integration services.  However, you can use
option `--undercover' (`-u') of command `test' to easily change
this.  Value of the option must be a comma and/or space-separated
list of any of the following flags:

  - `auto' (default), `on' (or `always'), `off' (or `never'):
    whether to collect coverage statistics and generate a report;

  - `coveralls' (default), `simplecov', `codecov', `text': format
    of the generated report;

  - `merge' or `restart' (default): whether to merge with
    existing report file or delete it and create new report from
    scratch; simple text reports are never merged;

  - `send' (default), `dontsend': whether to upload the report to
    coveralls.io (only for `coveralls' format);

  - `safe' (default) or `force': whether to run `undercover' even
    if the plugin detects it likely won't work on this Emacs version
    (currently these options do nothing; they had been used
    before `undercover' 0.7 got released and are kept for
    compatibility and in case they get needed again in the
    future).

Most flags have their default value provided by `undercover'
library itself.  As of version 0.8 those are `coveralls' and
`send'.  However, defaults can also be changed in project's file
`Eldev'.

Additionally, option `--undercover-report' (`-U') lets you change
the report's filename.  Default value is controlled by the
library.

When `eldev-dwim' is non-nil (default), certain flags can affect
each other:

  - if report format is not set explicitly it is derived from
    extension of report filename if possible: `.json' for
    `simplecov' format, `.txt' or `.text' for a text report;

  - when requested format is not `coveralls', report is always
    generated unless `auto' or `off' (`never') is specified
    explicitly.

This special handling is aimed at reports created for local use,
i.e. usually in `simplecov' format.  Default values are normally
for coveralls.io and the report only gets generated on supported
continuous integration services."
