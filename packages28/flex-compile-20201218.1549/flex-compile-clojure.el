This is a REPL based compiler that allows for evaluation Clojure
buffers, expressions and starting the REPL using
\[Cider](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider).

The Clojure compiler connects using two Cider modes: the default `jack-in'
mode or connecting to a host and port remotely with `cider-connect'.  You can
switch betwee these two methods with the [given keybindings](#key-bindings):

  `M-x 1 C-u C-x C-u'

See documetation with `M-h f flex-compiler-query-eval' method for more
inforamtion (and current binding).

Todo: support multiple Cider buffers as this implementation currently does
not.")
