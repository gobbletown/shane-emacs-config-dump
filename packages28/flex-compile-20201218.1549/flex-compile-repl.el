;;; Commentary:

;; Run, evaluate and compile functionality for a variety of different languages
;; and modes.  The specific "compilation" method is different across each
;; add-on library.  For example, for ESS and Clojure you can evaluate a
;; specific file and/or evaluate a specfic expression via a REPL.  For running
;; a script or starting a `make` an async process is started.
