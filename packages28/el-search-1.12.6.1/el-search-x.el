(el-search-defpattern l (&rest lpats)
  "Alternative pattern type for matching lists.
Match any list with subsequent elements matched by all LPATS in
order.

The idea is to be able to search for pieces of code (i.e. lists)
with very brief input by using a specialized syntax.

An LPAT can take the following forms (the special interpretation
of symbols and strings can be turned off by binding or
customizing `el-search-lazy-l' to nil):

SYMBOL  Matches any symbol S matched by SYMBOL's name interpreted
        as a regexp.
'SYMBOL Matches the SYMBOL.
STRING  Matches any string matched by STRING interpreted as a
        regexp.
_       Matches any list element.
__      Matches any number (including zero) of list elements.
^       Matches zero elements, but only at the beginning of a list.
        Only allowed as the first of the LPATS.
$       Matches zero elements, but only at the end of a list.
        Only allowed as the last of the LPATS.
PAT     Anything else is interpreted as a standard pattern and
        matches one list element matched by it.  Note: If
        matching PAT binds any symbols, occurrences in any
        following patterns are not turned into equivalence tests;
        the scope of symbol bindings is limited to the PAT
        itself.

Example: To match defuns that contain \"hl\" in the defined name
and have at least one mandatory, but also optional arguments, you
could use this pattern:

    (l ^ 'defun hl (l _ &optional))"

NOT-PATTERN.


This pattern is useful to match only the outermost expression
when subexpressions would match recursively.  For
example, (outermost _) matches only top-level expressions.
Another example: For the `change' pattern, any subexpression of a
match is typically also an according change.  Wrapping the
`change' pattern into `outermost' prevents el-search from
descending into any found expression - only the outermost
expression matching the `change' pattern will be matched."
